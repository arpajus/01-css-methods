This is a repository where I'm going to put simple exercises of HTML and CSS just to practice and remind me or other people tha basics of both languages. 

MAP of the repository: 
01-css-methods: Here I just used css in the three differents ways you can do. By external css, by internal css and inline css. 
02-class-id-selectors: Here I'm adding id and classes on the HTML tags.
